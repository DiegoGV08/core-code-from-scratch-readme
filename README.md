### 1. Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages

#### Compiled programming languajes: 
When you write your source code in your computer, this code pass in a compiler to create a separate file that contains the machine code, (a languaje that only contain 1 and 0) and this is an execatuble file. You need to “rebuild” the program every time you need to make a change.  
The compiled programming languaje is ready to run, is private, faster, not cross-platform and needs to be compiled before use it.
#### Interpreted programming languajes: 
You don't need to compile your source code, you share a copy of your code and the web browser interpreted your javascript file, ths reads line by line and processing at the time.
The interpreted programming languaje is simpler to test, is public, slower, cross-platform, easier to debug and needs a interpreter.
### 2. Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?
Java is a combination of compiled and interpreted languaje. Java source code is compiled down to bytecode by the Java compiler. The bytecode is executed by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) making it as interpreted language.
### 3. Pseudocode Currency Converter exercise.
1. START
2. PRINT Enter amount in dollars to convert to BTC:
3. D <--- GET // Amount in dollars
4. S <--- 0.000022358 // amount of satoshis equivalent to 1 dollar  (8:02 pm - 04/05/2022)
5. B = D*S
6. PRINT Amount of BTC is:
7. PRINT B
8. END
### 4. High and Low level languages
#### Low level languages:
Low level language, is a language that is very close to hardware and can be directly executable on the computing hardware without any compiler or interpreter.
#### High level languages:
High level language, is a languaje that is very close to humans language, is easier to read, write and maintain.
